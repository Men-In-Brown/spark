# **Title: "Spark"**

## **Introduction:**
In a world buzzing with technology, we believe it's time to revolutionize the school experience. Introducing "Spark," a dynamic platform inspired by the Saturn app. This hub goes beyond the conventional, bringing students together through innovative features designed to enhance collaboration, time management, and community engagement.

### **Features to Fuel Connection and Productivity:**

#### **1. Live Class Timer:**
Stay on track with a live timer that displays how much time is left in each class. This feature helps students manage their time effectively, fostering a sense of discipline and punctuality.

#### **2. Schedule Matcher:**
Connect with peers effortlessly! The Schedule Matcher allows students to find out which classes they share with others. Strengthen bonds within the school community by discovering common schedules and creating study groups or collaborative projects.

#### **3. Personalized Student Profiles:**
Empower students with personalized profiles. Input your name, socials, and more, creating a digital identity within the school hub. This feature promotes individual expression and facilitates easy connections between students.

```html
<!-- Example Student Profile HTML -->
<div class="student-profile">
  <img src="profile-pic.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">
  <h1>John Doe</h1>
  <p class="socials">
    <a href="#" class="social-link">Twitter</a>
    <a href="#" class="social-link">Instagram</a>
    <a href="#" class="social-link">Snapchat</a>
  </p>
</div>
```

#### **4. Class Chat Feature:**
Enhance class communication through dedicated chat features. Students can engage in real-time discussions, share resources, and collaborate seamlessly within each class. Foster a supportive learning environment through easy communication.

#### **5. District-wide Roles:**
Establish roles for each school across the district. Whether it's administrators, teachers, or students, assign distinct roles to streamline communication and ensure a structured hierarchy within the school hub.

#### **6. Calendar Integration for Clubs/Sports:**
Add a dynamic layer to the calendar by integrating club meetings. Students can mark their club affiliations on the calendar, making it easy to manage commitments and stay involved in various extracurricular activities.

```html
<!-- Example Calendar Integration for Clubs HTML -->
<div class="calendar-event">
  <h2>Chess Club Meeting</h2>
  <p>Date: October 15, 2024</p>
  <p>Time: 3:00 PM - 4:30 PM</p>
</div>
```

#### **8. Bitmoji Animated Profile:**
We will implement Sprite into our profile customization where users can create their own profile look and showcase that on their profile as their bitmoji.

#### **9. Bootstrap Implementation:**
We are going to implement bootstrap to make this usable for cellular devices like your iPhone and Android. 

```sass
// Functions first
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";

// Variable overrides second
$primary: #900;
$enable-shadows: true;
$prefix: "mo-";

// Required Bootstrap imports
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables-dark";
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/maps";
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/mixins";
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/root";

// Optional components
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/utilities";
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/reboot";
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/containers";
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/grid";
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/helpers";
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/utilities/api";
```

## **Conclusion:**
Spark is not just a platform; it's a catalyst for positive change. As we embark on this journey, let's embrace the power of connectivity, collaboration, and intentional habits. Together, let's build a stronger, more engaged school community where every student thrives. The countdown begins to a new era in education with Spark!
